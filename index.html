          <p>
            The media often features headlines about extreme spikes and tragic crashes in the price of Bitcoin (BTC),
            but very little is ever said about the <i>amount</i> of the cryptocurrency being traded.<br><br>
            The total value that has been bought and sold in a specified period of time (technically known as <b>volume</b>)
            is often analyzed with price changes to identify the existence, continuation or reversal of a trend.
            <br><br>
            Consequently, volume indicators can provide investors with signals for when to buy or when to sell.
            In general, volume and price work together to create such signals as follows: <sup>[1]</sup>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Increasing volume + increasing prices: </b><br>potential buying opportunity</li>
            <li><b>Increasing volume + decreasing prices: </b><br>best to stay on the sidelines</li>
            <li><b>Decreasing volume + increasing prices: </b><br>may indicate a coming reversal and a time to buy</li>
            <li><b>Decreasing volume + decreasing prices: </b><br>opportunity to sell and take profits</li>
          </ul>

          <p style="color:#A93226; font-size:larger;"> <b>Bitcoin Breaks Out</b></p>
          <p>
            Although Bitcoin had been around for a number of years, 2017 marks the first year it truly
            gained widespread, public attention.<br><br>
            In a year when the value of one BTC increased 20-fold, it's no surprise interest in the asset exploded and monthly volume increased 80x.
            The tight connection between price and volume quickly became a feedback loop that many deemed a bubble. <br><br>
            Still, the signal to participate was too strong to ignore, and Bitcoin officially went global:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Major banks such as Barclays, Citi Bank and Deutsche Bank annouce they are investigating ways they might be able to work with Bitcoin. <sup>[2]</sup></li><br>
            <li>Japan and Russia annouce plans to accept bitcoin as a legal payment method and legalize the use of cryptocurrencies. <sup>[3]</sup></li><br>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="2018" hidden>
          <p style="color:#E74C3C; font-size:larger;"> <b>Crypto Winter</b></p>
          <p>
            After soaring by an order of magnitude in 2017, itâ€™s easy to understand why insiders refer to 2018 as the Crypto Winter.<br><br>
            In early January, the first (and largest) of many major hacks resulted in the loss of over $500 million in crypto.<sup>[4]</sup>
            As hacks continued, many lost confidence in crypto's promise as a long-term store of value.<br><br>
            Investors and speculators keen to cash in their newfound wealth were quickly replaced by hackers and criminals.
            Much like the previous year, price and volume changes were in lockstep creating momentum and another feedback loop.<br><br>
            This time, however, the signal was to sell.
          </p>

          <!-- <ul>
            <li>Online payment company Stripe announces it will phase out support for BTC payments.<sup>[2]</sup></li><br>
          </ul> -->
        </div>
        <div class="2019" hidden>
          <p style="color:#f0b216; font-size:larger;"> <b>Rapid Recovery</b></p>
          After the boom and bust of 2017 and 2018, respectively, options trading gained momentum as
          the NYSE launched its market for Bitcoin futures. An explosion in the exchange market led to
          more aggressive competition and efficient markets, benefiting traders.<sup>[5]</sup> <br><br>

          With a renewed sense of legitimacy and increased access the public, the volume of Bitcoin trading
          increased sharply initiating yet another major signal to interested traders to (re)enter the market. Meanwhile,

          <ul>
            <li>The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, publicly supports blockchain technology after previously announcing plans to ban Bitcoin mining.<sup>[5]</sup></li><br>
            <li>Facebook announces the development of its own cryptocurrency, Libra.<sup>[6]</sup></li><br>
            <li>Multiple retailers announce they will acceptance payments in the form of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.<sup>[6]</sup></li>
          </ul>

        </div>
        <div class="2020" hidden>
          <p style="color:#339966; font-size:larger;"> <b>Crypto During COVID</b></p>

          With the announcement of major stimulus packages across the globe and the injection of
          trillions of dollars into the global economy, many argued that the fixed supply of 21 million
          coins would cause Bitcoin to behave less like an asset and more like a commodity such as gold...and
          therefore serve as an opportunity to hedge against inflation.<br><br>

          While the argument appears valid, the hypothesis was ultimately unverified.
          Many experts still considered Bitcoin a highly speculative asset, but fear surrounding
          the financial effects of the pandemic surpassed uncertainty about crypto as
          investors were eager to find a safe haven.<br><br>

          Ultimately, amid low interest rates and extreme financial uncertainty, Bitcoin surged by 300% in 2020
          based on speculation that investors would hoard the digital currency.<sup>[7]</sup>


        </div>
        <div class="2021" hidden>
          <p style="color:#5965A3; font-size:larger;"> <b>A New Scale</b></p>

          After soaring over 400% and reaching an all-time high of nearly $30K the previous year, the price of 1
          BTC still managed to double in the first three months of 2021, with a market cap in excess of $1 trillion. <br><br>

          The digital currency promptly fell 50% back to $30K before eventually rebounding to a new high and crashing again.
          Monthly volume was also breaking new ground and receeding drastically; the digital currency was experiencing volatility on a whole new scale. <br><br>

          Despite signifiacnt milestones in the crypto market, uncertainty about inflation and the emergence of
          the Omicron variant continued to spook investors<sup>[8]</sup>:

          <ul>
            <li>Major crypto exchange, Coinbase, goes public.</li><br>
            <li>El Salvador becomes the first country to accept Bitcoin as legal tender.</li><br>
            <li>Morgan Stanley becomes the first big U.S. bank to offer its wealthy clients access to bitcoin funds.</li>
          </ul>

        <div class="2022" hidden>
          <p style="color:#730099; font-size:larger;"> <b>Historic Inflation</b></p>

          As supply chains are stretched, record inflation persists and stocks tumble,
          Bitcoin and other cryptocoins face another test of resiliance against major market forces.
          <br><br>
          Earlier this year, TerraUSD - a stablecoin specifically designed to minimize volatility - lost its peg with
          the U.S. dollar causing it and its companion token Luna to collapse.
          The news triggered massive panic over broader crypto markets that resulted in a domino effect of
          liquidations and bankruptcies.<sup>[4]</sup>
          <br><br>
          While interest remains high, the crypto market and related regulation remain in their infancy but continue to evolve.

          New applications of blockchain technology like NFTs and the Metaverse continue to
          entice investors, but the history of booms and busts has others wary of another bubble.
          <br><br>
          Whatever happens next, it's clear that interest is a tale of two metrics...and it behooves investors to also consider
          <b>volume</b> before their next trade.
